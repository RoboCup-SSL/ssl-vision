  \brief   The main header for the VarTypes system
  \author  Stefan Zickler, (C) 2008

  This is the main header for the VarTypes system.
  It provides definitions for all base-types.

  \b About:     VarTypes are an object-oriented, abstracted
                framework for handling variables of all primitive, but
                also arbitrarily complex types.

  \b Features:  VarTypes allow hierarchical orginazation, thread-safety,
                load/store to/from xml, optional QT4-based signals,
                and optional QT4-based model/view visualization.
                Supported base types are int, bool, double, string,
                lists, binary data (uchar* blocks).
                More complex types can be added easily by inheriting the
                VarType base-class.

  \b Usage:     All VarTypes extend the base-class VarType (see \c VarType.h )
