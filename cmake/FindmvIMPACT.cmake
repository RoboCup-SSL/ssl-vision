# FindmvIMPACT.cmake - Find mvIMPACT sdk, version >= 4.
# Modified from FindEigen.cmake by alexs.mac@gmail.com  (Alex Stewart)
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# mvIMPACT_FOUND: TRUE if mvimpact is found.
# mvIMPACT_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for mvimpact.
# mvIMPACT_LIBRARIES: Libraries for all mvimpact component libraries and
#                     dependencies.
#
# mvIMPACT_VERSION: Extracted from lib/libmvBlueFOX .so.x.y.z
# mvIMPACT_WORLD_VERSION: Equal to 4 if mvIMPACT_VERSION = 4.0.5
# mvIMPACT_MAJOR_VERSION: Equal to 0 if mvIMPACT_VERSION = 4.0.5
# mvIMPACT_MINOR_VERSION: Equal to 5 if mvIMPACT_VERSION = 4.0.5
#
# The following variables control the behaviour of this module:
#
# mvIMPACT_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                             search for mvimpact includes, e.g: /foo/include.
# mvIMPACT_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                             search for mvimpact libraries, e.g: /bar/lib.
#
# The following variables are also defined by this module, but in line with
# CMake recommended FindPackage() module style should NOT be referenced directly
# by callers (use the plural variables detailed above instead).  These variables
# do however affect the behaviour of the module via FIND_[PATH/LIBRARY]() which
# are NOT re-called (i.e. search for library is not repeated) if these variables
# are set with valid values _in the CMake cache_. This means that if these
# variables are set directly in the cache, either by the user in the CMake GUI,
# or by the user passing -DVAR=VALUE directives to CMake when called (which
# explicitly defines a cache variable), then they will be used verbatim,
# bypassing the HINTS variables and other hard-coded search locations.
#
# mvIMPACT_INCLUDE_DIR: Include directory for mvimpact, not including the
#                       include directory of any dependencies.
# mvIMPACT_LIBRARY: mvimpact library, not including the libraries of any
#                   dependencies.

# Called if we failed to find mvimpact or any of it's required dependencies,
# unsets all public (designed to be used externally) variables and reports
# error message at priority depending upon [REQUIRED/QUIET/<NONE>] argument.
